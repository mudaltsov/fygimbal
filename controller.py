# Prototype serial remote control.
#
# - For BINARY PATCHED firmware only.
#   (Unpatched firmware will only have Yaw control)
#
# - Input via XBox 360 USB controller analog stick,
#   mapped to yaw/pitch speed control, with the control
#   software here tracking angles and applying angle limits.
#
# - Also runs a websocket server for live poking at parameters.
